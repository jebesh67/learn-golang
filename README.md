Hi.

I am starting to work with standard http library
in this repo I am learning golang file structure and error handling
also I need to work on logging practices

later in this repo I wanna try connecting database, caching, working with tokens also rate limiting

I also wanna learn to use goroutines, and other bunch of standard libs like context
also wanna work with golang logics, good practices

I have previously learned about shadowing, pointers, slices. structs, arrays, interfaces

there's still a lot more to learn, and I am looking forward to it
